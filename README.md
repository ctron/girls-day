This is a repository hosting source code and board layouts for the tutorials we
do at [Girls'Day](https://www.girls-day.de/).

As everything is open source, feel free to re-use, distribute or modifiy this content.
Of course feedback, suggestions and improvements are always welcome.

## Board layouts

The board layouts are made with [Fritzing](fritzing.org/). You can download and install this
from their homepage.

## Projects

We use the [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
to view, edit, compile and upload the projects to the boards.

### Blinkenlights

The projects blinkenlights 1 to 3 show some basics. LEDs and a button.

### Morse Code

Hook up two boards via MQTT and let them link over the "cloud".
